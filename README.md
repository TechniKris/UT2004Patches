# OldUnreal Patch Repository for Unreal Tournament 2004

This is the public repository for [OldUnreal's](https://www.oldunreal.com/index.html) Unreal Tournament 2004 patches. OldUnreal took over maintenance of the Unreal Tournament code base after reaching an agreement with [Epic Games](https://www.epicgames.com) in 2025.

Our patches fix stability, security, and performance bugs in the game client, server and editor. They also add quality-of-life features and support for modern platforms and operating systems.

Patch releases hosted here are considered stable enough for widespread use, but they are by no means a finished product. We still release updates on a regular basis.

**Legal Disclaimer:** This project was approved by Epic Games, but it is not an official Epic project, nor has it been reviewed or tested by Epic.

## Installation

This repository contains release previews as well as official releases.

### Release Previews

If you are a modder or beta tester and you would like to test our latest changes, then simply use git to check out this repository. Note, however, that release previews may be less stable than the official releases.

### Official Releases

Our official patch releases can be found on the [Releases Page](https://github.com/OldUnreal/UT2004Patches/releases). If you are a regular player or if you want to play online, then please use official releases only.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to test out our patches, but maintain the possibility to uninstall them, we strongly urge you to create a backup of your entire UT2004 folder before installing the patch.

## Windows Installation

We distribute our patches for **Windows** systems in multiple formats. We recommend that you run the exe installer to patch your game.

However, you can also simply unpack the zip package **on top of an existing installation** of Unreal Tournament 2004. No other actions are needed to install the patch.

## Linux Installation

The **Linux** version of our patch is only available as a tarball. To install, unpack the tarball **on top of an existing installation** of Unreal Tournament 2004.

Alternatively, to spare you the pain of using Wine to install the Windows version, you can unpack our patch into an empty directory, which we will refer to as the **game directory**. You can then install the rest of the game as follows:

> [!NOTE]
> The directory names below are Case Sensitive!

1) **Mount** the UT2004 cd/image or unpack the GOG distribution with the **innoextract** tool. We will refer to the root directory of your game cd/image or GOG distribution as the **distribution directory**.
2) Copy the **Animations**, **Help**, **KarmaData**, **maps**, **Music**, **Prefabs**, **Sounds**, **Speech**, **StaticMeshes**, **Textures**, and **Web** directories from the distribution directory into the game directory.

> [!CAUTION]
> Please ensure that you do **NOT** copy the contents of the System directory in your cd/GoG image into the game directory, otherwise the game will not launch!

At this point you're all set. No other actions are needed to install the patch.

## macOS Installation

The macOS version of our patch comes as an application bundle. You should drag this bundle into your applications library. If you're installing our macOS patch for the first time, you will also need to copy the data files from an existing UT installation into your Application Support Library. To install the data files, you need to do the following:
1. Open a new Finder window
2. Press ⇧⌘G to bring up the "Go to folder:" dialog
3. Enter "~/Library/Application Support/" (without the quotes!) in the edit box and click ok
4. Within the ~/Library/Application Support/ folder, create a new folder called "Unreal Tournament 2004" (without the quotes!)
5. Copy the **Animations**, **Help**, **KarmaData**, **maps**, **Music**, **Prefabs**, **Sounds**, **Speech**, **StaticMeshes**, **Textures**, and **Web** from your existing UT2004 installation into the folder you've just created

> [!CAUTION]
> Please ensure that you do **NOT** copy the contents of the original game's System directory into ~/Library/Application Support/, otherwise the game will not launch!

After installing the data files, you should be able to launch the UnrealTournament2004 app!

## System Requirements

Windows and Linux systems need a 64-bit Intel CPU or 64-bit ARM CPU.

Windows systems need to run Windows 7 or later.

Linux systems need to run a fairly recent distribution. The patch was developed on Ubuntu 24.04.

macOS systems need a 64-bit Intel or Apple Silicon CPU and Mac OS X Mavericks (10.9) or later. Some rendering features may be unavailable on macOS.

## Features

Besides fixing hundreds of bugs, the OldUnreal UT2004 patches currently also add features such as:
* SDL3-based window management for the Linux and macOS clients
* UTF-8 support for game ini, int, and log files
* An updated in-game server browser with lots of quality-of-life improvements

We will update this list as we add more features.

A full list of patch features and changes is available in the [Release Notes](https://github.com/OldUnreal/UT2004Patches/blob/master/ReleaseNotes.md). 

## Malware Warnings

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Our Windows and macOS binaries are digitally signed, but malware/virus scanners may occasionally still flag them as potential malware because our signing certificate is still building up reputation. Additional information can be found [here](https://www.digicert.com/blog/ms-smartscreen-application-reputation/).
