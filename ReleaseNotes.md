## Unreal Tournament 2004 Version 3374 Release Notes

Version 3374 is completely network compatible with the previous public release of UT2004 (3369). 

### Patch Highlights

* We now natively support Linux and macOS systems with x86_64/amd64 and arm64/aarch64 CPUs 
* You can now play the game or run a server on a Raspberry Pi 4 or 5, albeit at rather slower frame-rate than on a PC!
* The Linux and macOS distributions of the patch now include a fully functional UCC with an UnrealScript compiler (UCC make)
* We dropped support for 32-bit CPUs, for old versions of Windows (i.e., Vista or earlier), and for DirectX 8
* The Windows version of the game now requires DirectX 9
* The Linux and macOS versions now use SDL3 instead of SDL1

#### UnrealScript

* We fixed a plethora of accessed nones and UnrealScript-based exploits, crash bugs, and denial-of-service attacks (Thank you Wormbo and Shambler!)
* We fixed a bug that could make the SPMA camera explosion loop without stopping ([#24](../../issues/24))
* The PlayerController.AskForPawn function now jumps to the Spectating.Begin state correctly ([#10](../../issues/10))
* The PlayerController.ToggleScreenShotMode function no longer discards user preferences such as the weapon handedness, crosshair visibility, HUD visibility, and the TeamBeaconMaxDist and bHideVehicleNoEntryIndicator settings ([#11](../../issues/11))
* The DeathMatch.InitTeamSymbols function can no longer give multiple teams the same symbol ([#16](../../issues/16))
* We fixed a bug where gibbed players or monsters can be gibbed multiple times by sources of constant damage
* We fixed several bugs that made Engine.Canvas incorrectly process newline characters and color codes
* We fixed a bug that made the Linux and macOS clients crash when loading font textures with remapped fonts
* We fixed a bug that could make the game crash after calling LinkMesh on a new skeletal mesh that uses dynamic hitboxes
